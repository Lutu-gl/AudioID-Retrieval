# MusicFingerprinting ðŸŽµ  
**An Audio Identification System for Music Retrieval**  

---

## **Overview**  
This project implements a **music retrieval system** capable of identifying audio tracks from short, distorted queries.  
Inspired by **Avery Wang's Shazam algorithm** (ISMIR 2003), the system processes audio data, generates constellation maps, and matches queries against a database of tracks.  

The project is part of the **Information Retrieval course**, focusing on content-based audio retrieval and efficient matching strategies.

## **Features**  
- **Audio Query Processing**: Extract 10-second segments and simulate various distortions:
  - Original (unmodified)
  - Noise (Gaussian noise added)
  - Coding (compressed audio with artifacts)
  - Mobile recording (outdoor playback and re-recording)  
- **Constellation Maps**: Generate time-frequency representations for efficient matching.  
- **Matching and Retrieval**: Perform query matching against a music database using precision, recall, and other metrics.  
- **Scalability**: Extend the system to larger datasets and more efficient hashing approaches in future milestones.
